# cppd - Cpp-Dependencies

**Cpp-Dependencies** is a *work in progress* to (hopefully) help use c++ projects with npm.

**Motivation:** npm is an awesome package manager that allows the fast creation of node projects by joining small libraries. *C/C++* still lacks a tool like that. There is [biicode](https://www.biicode.com/), but is only for CMake.
